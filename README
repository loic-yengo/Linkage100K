(1) predLink
predLink is a C++-based program that predicts linkage signals from association results
Input:
- an IBD file (--ibd):  specifies for each position (in cM) what is the IBD probability. IBD probability output from Merlin
- a step size (--step): Specifies step between markers to make prediction. Default is 1 (minimum is 1 cM).
- a genotype file (--bfile): binary PLINK format for genotypes
- a GWAS summary statistics file (--sumstat)
- a chromosome number (--chr)
- an output prefix (--out)

==> predLink can be compiled by typing: make
==> Help can be accessed by typing: ./predLink --help


(2) 01_sim-sib-array.R
This R script simulates genotypes of siblings from a set of haplotypes (from 962 trios in the UK Biobank) and recombination map.
Input data are
Maps: a folder containing 22 maps for each autosome (maps were downloaded from bcfTool website)
Haplotypes: a folder containg 22 .RData file (one for each autsome). Each RData file is matrix of phased haplotypes
map file: a PLINK map file
bim file: a PLINK bim file

Output
- PLINK format genotypes for sibling pairs
- RData objects containing the coordinates (chromosome, start, stop) and status of all IBD segments

(3) sibREML_v0.1.1.R
This R script implements a REstricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation of genetic variance for independent families.
The Average-Information algorithm implemented in this R script was previously described in Yang et al. AJHG (2011).

(4) Summarised_genetic_map.txt
This files contains 6388 (+1 header) rows and 5 columns sumamrising the genetic and physical coordinates of loci used in linkage analyses.
